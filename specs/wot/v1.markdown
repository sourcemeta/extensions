## Abstract

This document specifies a JSON Schema vocabulary that extends JSON Schema with
keywords from the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description specification. The
vocabulary provides mechanisms to annotate schemas with semantic type
information, multi-language human-readable metadata, and physical unit
information.

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## 1. Introduction

The [W3C Web of Things Thing Description
1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/) specification defines a
standard format for describing IoT devices and their capabilities. A key
component of this specification is the Data Schema, which describes the data
format used for validation. This vocabulary brings the WoT Data Schema
extension keywords to JSON Schema. All keywords in this vocabulary are emitted as
annotations and do not perform validation.

## 2. The `@type` Keyword

The `@type` keyword provides a JSON-LD mechanism that links definitions in a
schema to concepts in an RDF ontology. This enables semantic interoperability
by associating schema elements with well-defined terms from external
vocabularies.

The value of `@type` MUST be either a string or a non-empty array of strings.
Each string SHOULD be a valid URI or compact URI (CURIE) referencing a term in
an ontology.

```json
{ "@type": "saref:Temperature" }
```

```json
{ "@type": [ "saref:Temperature", "schema:QuantitativeValue" ] }
```

## 3. The `titles` Keyword

The `titles` keyword provides multi-language human-readable titles for a
schema.

The value of `titles` MUST be an object with at least one property. Each
property name MUST be a valid [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646)
language tag, and each property value MUST be a string containing the title in
that language.

```json
{
  "titles": {
    "en": "Temperature",
    "de": "Temperatur"
  }
}
```

## 4. The `descriptions` Keyword

The `descriptions` keyword provides multi-language human-readable descriptions
for a schema.

The value of `descriptions` MUST be an object with at least one property. Each
property name MUST be a valid [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646)
language tag, and each property value MUST be a string containing the
description in that language.

```json
{
  "descriptions": {
    "en": "The current temperature reading from the sensor",
    "de": "Der aktuelle Temperaturwert vom Sensor"
  }
}
```

## 5. The `unit` Keyword

The `unit` keyword annotates a schema with physical unit information. The value
of `unit` MUST be a string representing a valid SI unit symbol as defined in
the [SI Brochure (9th edition,
2019)](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure).

```json
{
  "type": "number",
  "unit": "°C"
}
```
